## Description
A fingerprinting engine that creates value from abusive traffic by generating attacker YARA signatures of various strictness levels to apply differing levels of mitigating friction. The tool further deploys honeypot entities to proactively perform threat actor attribution to identify and action against malicious actors rotating IP addresses.

### Mechanism
A honeypot webpage fingerprints a malicious actor's device and browser information. Upon visit the login page, `fingerprint.js` will be executed. The captured fingerprint gets forwarded to SIEM and the YARA signature is created. 
To lure attackers, credentials can be released via `scythe` on public sites whereupon successful logon using those credentials would reveal malicious actors and fingerprinting is completed. Failed login attempts are also fingerprinted once rate-limiting thresholds are exceeded or when brute-forcing is detected. Upon such a detection, `main.py` will be executed and **3 levels of YARA signatures of varying strictness will be created**:

| Levels            | 1                                                                                                                            | 2                                                                 | 3                                                                                                                                                        |

| Description       | signature bears least amount of specificity                                                                                  | signature bears broad definitions that are likely to be malicious | signature bears precise details, such as fingerprint + IP, such that layer 7 blocks are only applied to actor and not other users on shared IP addresses |
| Suggested Control | apply rate-limiting policies based on this signature, ie. block the 20th requests coming in within 10 minutes for 15 minutes | throw Google re-captcha on new visits that matches this signature | block requests matching this signature at layer 7                                                                                                        |

1. Upon successful/failed login, the page will load fingerprint.php
2. Login status gets logged and monitored by splunk
3. Fingerprint.php collects fingerprint from the actor's device and broswer
4. Fingerprint.php creates a randomly generated PHP file name for retrieving POST data
5. Fingerprint Data is POSTED to the generated PHP file
6. The generated PHP file, logs the fingerprint whoch would be monitored by splunk
7. The generated PHP file deletes itself after PHP is fully executed
8. Upon alert from SIEM Splunk (customizable by the user), it executes main.py 
9. Main.py extracts the appropriate fingerprint for that event
10. Main.py will finally generate 3 main types of Yara signatures where used for **Rate Limiting**, **Challenge**, **Block** 


## Aftermath of Alert Triggers
The main.py located at ```/opt/splunk/bin/scripts``` will be executed</br>
The script will hash the JSON formated fingerprints and verifies for any duplicates in hash.txt

**If Duplicate Exist:**
- Do nothing

<br>**If NO Duplicates Exist:**
- Update the myhash.txt
- Create a new folder named: yara-(Hash values of the JSON fingerprints）, in the folder it will consist:
  1. yara_ratelimit
  2. yara_challenge
  3. yara_block

## Use Cases

Attackers have been using multiple methods to exploit sites, services, steal credentials and more. When successful, attackers can use that to gain access to restricted sites, information or  permissions. We provide proactive approaches to engage the attackers early on.

<br /><br />

### Scenario 1: Login Abuses such as Brute-forcing (incl. Password Spraying, Credentials Dumping) via IP Rotate
> Attackers may bypass rate-limiting controls by employing IP-rotate techniques, thus we fingerprint the attackers device and browser for attribution

`Attackers may attempt to perform bruteforce (when unsuccesful login occurs, fingerprinting of attacker's device is collected)`

### Scenario 2: Honeypot Credentials for Attribution of Threat Actors Triggering the Tripwires
> Releasing fake credentials on such places will lure attackers to our site, giving us information about their fingerprints.

`Release of our honeypot website credentials on pastebins`

### Scenario 3: Honeypot Website for Threat Intelligence
> Launching scythe with a honeypot / fake site (of a similar industry) to fingerprint malicious traffic for signature creation. The honeypot could be placed under a dummy subdomain of an organization. This feed of signatures can then be shared with the open-source threat intelligence community or consumed internally.

`The attacker used the unkowing Paypal honeypot released credentials to sign into a honeypot account`

## Adding additional Honeypot Credentials
### Manual Method

When logging in, `login/index.php` will compare the entered credentials to a `creds.txt` lookup file. If any of those credentials exist and match in the lookup file, the actor will be successfully logged in.

The 1st field represents `email address` while the 2nd field represents `password`. The 3rd field represents nothing but you would have to place something to prevent PHP errors.

---

To add credentials, append new credentials to the next line using the mentioned format

<br />

### Automatic Method (with pastebin api POST)
This method automatically creates the credentials and appends them to `creds.txt`. Another step is carried out where the created credentials are released on Pastebin to lure attackers. This is achieved by executing [pastebin_api.py](/pastebin_api.py)

```shell
sudo python3 pastebin_api.py
```
Upon executing, it whether ask you for `custom/default` message

|                | Custom Option   | Default Options           |
|  :---          |      :---:      |      :---:                |
| Email Field    | `Custom`        | `Automatically Generated` |
| Password Field | `Custom`        | `Automatically Generated` |
| Message Field  | `Custom`        | `Default`                 |
| Append Creds into `creds.txt`  | `Automatic`   | `Automatic` |

Before executing `pastebin_api.py`, you will have to assign your `dev_api_key` in that file. `dev_api_key` can be retrieved from `https://pastebin.com/doc_api` (you will need an Pastebin account)

After successfuly executing `pastebin_api.py`, the honeypot credentials would be uploaded to Pastbin and appended to `creds.txt`

## Integration

When you want the user fingerprints to be collected & logged, include the following code `require "../fingerprint.php";`. This can be placed on the home page, or when the user has performed a **successful**/**failed** login. **Do make sure that the current path is writable by web-service**

The fingerprint will be logged at `/var/log/fingerprint/log.txt` path. So create one if doesn't exist. Make sure it is given appropriate permissions for web-service to write into the log file

`main.py` is responsible for extracting fingerprint logs and converting them into signatures. Signatures can be found on the following path `/opt/signatures`. **Do make sure to create an empty file `myhash.txt` before executing `main.py`**


## Why create signatures from browser fingerprints

### Reduce False Positives
Organisations have been mostly using only IP Addresses to deal with bad actors. Sometimes this information is not enough as these IP's could come from organisations, merchants, or any shared groups. These can largely affect customers when using single information like IP for blocks, challenges or rate-limiting. Thus, to limit false positives, we can use browser fingerprints to uniquely identify bad actors among actors for defensive measures without affecting customers and merchants.

### Simplicity
It is very easy to obtain browser fingerprints using JavaScript or logs. It can be done in the background without affecting the customer’s experience. This makes it simple for organisations to deploy tools for browser fingerprinting.

### High Redundancy
Browser fingerprints can be broken down to other multiple information such as header, IP, hardware, canvas hash, etc. So even if 1 or more information is missing, a proper signature can still be crafted for various use cases and confidence levels.

## Moving Forward
- Using the created signature yara_block to create automated blocking capabilities
- Integration of more SIEM tools
- Fingerprint more information
- Customize your own signatures easily
